# L1: OOP Basics

"""
A programming paradigm is a way to classify programming languages based on
their features.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the programming paradigm that allows using
object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) to model software design around
objects rather than logic or functions.

Objects are real-world entities that you can feel, manipulate and sense. For
example, an object can represent a person with the following properties: age,
name, gender, and behaviours like eating, sleeping, walking, etc.
