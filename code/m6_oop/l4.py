# L4: Magic Methods

"""
In Python, there is a function called dir(), which lists all the attributes of
the given object, and if you use dir() function for your object or object
class, you will discover attributes like __class__, __doc__, __str__ etc. These
are called magic methods because they are implicitly called when some action
happens.
